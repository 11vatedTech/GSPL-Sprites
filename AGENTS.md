# GSPL Sprites engineering contract

GSPL Sprites is an independent downstream product. The adjacent GSPL canon and
all `Reference-repos_and_planning` repositories are read-only evidence. Never
import them, modify them, or require them to build, test, run, or package this
repository.

Production code must be deterministic by default, typed, bounded, validated,
and covered by meaningful tests. Semantic entity state is authoritative;
rendered assets are target projections. Unsupported semantics must produce
diagnostics and must never be silently discarded.

No generated model output may enter a release package without model identity,
license, source hash, determinism class, and provenance. No external input is
trusted. Do not add network access to the compiler or runtime core.
